* Speed challenge - give initial BST and list of ops (e.g. rotate, insert), then figure out final tree as fast as possible
* Question types:
  * Max/mind root of BST with n levels containing keys 1...k
  * Is this a BST
  * Give pre/in/post/level traversal of this tree
  * Rotations to bring X to root
  * Where would X be inserted
  * State of AVL after inserting X
  * How many comparisons to lookup X
  * Is this balanced
  * Balance factor of node X
